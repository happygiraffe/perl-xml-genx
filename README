XML-Genx version 0.01
=====================

Genx is a software library written in the C programming language. You
can use it to generate XML output, suitable for saving into a file or
sending in a message to another computer program. Genx does several
things at once:

    * Takes care of escaping XML's special characters for you.
    * Keeps you from generating text which isn't well-formed.
    * Generates namespace prefixes so you don't have to.
    * Produces documents which are Canonical XML, suitable for use
      with digital-signature technology.
    * Tries to do all this efficiently.

XML::Genx is a wrapper around Genx to let it be used from Perl.
