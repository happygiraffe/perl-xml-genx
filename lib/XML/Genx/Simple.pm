=head1 NAME

XML::Genx::Simple - A slightly simpler wrapper class for genx

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XML::Genx::Simple;
  my $w = XML::Genx::Simple->new;
  eval {
    # <root><foo id="1">bar</foo></root>
    $w->StartDocFile( *STDOUT );
    $w->StartElementLiteral( 'root' );
    $w->Element( foo => 'bar', id => 1 );
    $w->EndElement;
    $w->EndDocument;
  };
  die "Writing XML failed: $@" if $@;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides some helper methods to make using XML::Genx
simpler in the common case.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item StartDocString ( )

Starts a new document, and collects the result into a string.

This method is offered as an extension to the genx API since it is
significantly quicker.  Many thanks to A. Pagaltzis for suggesting it.

=item GetDocString ( )

Returns the string from the current writer object.  

B<NB>: This is only guaranteed to be well-formed XML after you have
called EndDocument().

B<NB>: This will only produce sensible output if you've called
StartDocString() previously.

=item Element ( NAME, TEXT, [ATTRS] )

Outputs E<lt>NAMEE<gt>TEXTE<lt>/NAMEE<gt> in one go.  NAME can be
either a text string or an XML::Genx::Element object.

If NAME is a text string, an XML::Genx::Element object will be
created, used and cached.  So there's no real advantage to passing one
in.

Optionally, ATTRS can be passed in as a list of key/value pairs.
Again, each key used as an attribute name will be cached.

This method provides no namespace support.
