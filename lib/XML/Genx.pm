=head1 NAME

XML::Genx - Simple, correct XML writer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use XML::Genx;
  my $w = XML::Genx->new;
  eval {
      # <foo>bar</foo>
      $w->StartDocFile( *STDOUT );
      $w->StartElementLiteral( 'foo' );
      $w->AddText( 'bar' );
      $w->EndElement;
      $w->EndDocument;
  };
  die "Writing XML failed: $@" if $@;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used for generating XML.  The underlying library (genx)
ensures that the output is well formed, canonical XML.  That is, all
characters are correctly encoded, namespaces are handled properly and
so on.

The API is mostly a wrapper over the original C library.  Consult the
genx documentation for the fine detail.  This code is based on genx
I<beta5>.

=head1 METHODS

All methods will die() when they encounter an error.  Otherwise they
return zero.

=over 4

=item new ( )

Constructor.  Returns a new L<XML::Genx> object.

=item StartDocFile ( FILEHANDLE )

Starts writing output to FILEHANDLE.

=item StartDocSender ( CALLBACK )

Takes a coderef (C< sub {} >), which gets called each time that genx
needs to output something.  CALLBACK will be called with two
arguments: the text to output and the name of the function that called
it (one of I<write>, I<write_bounded>, or I<flush>).

  $w->StartDocSender( sub { print $_[0] } );

In the case of I<flush>, the first argument will always be an empty
string.

The string passed to CALLBACK will always be UTF-8.

B<NB>: If you just want to append to a string, have a look at
L<XML::Genx::Simple/StartDocString>.

=item EndDocument ( )

Finishes writing to the output stream.

=item StartElementLiteral ( [NAMESPACE], LOCALNAME )

Starts an element LOCALNAME, in NAMESPACE.  If NAMESPACE is not
present or undef, or an empty string, no namespace is used.

=item AddAttributeLiteral ( [NAMESPACE], LOCALNAME, VALUE )

Adds an attribute LOCALNAME, with contents VALUE.  If NAMESPACE is not
present or undef, or an empty string, no namespace is used.

=item EndElement ( )

Output a closing tag for the currently open element.

=item LastErrorMessage ( )

Returns the string value of the last error.

=item LastErrorCode ( )

Returns the integer status code of the last error.  This can be
compared to one of the values in L<XML::Genx::Constants>.

This will return zero if no error condition is present.

This value cannot be relied upon to stay the same after further method
calls to the same object.

=item GetErrorMessage ( CODE )

Given a genxStatus code, return the equivalent string.

=item ScrubText ( STRING )

Returns a new version of STRING with prohibited characters removed.
Prohibited characters includes non UTF-8 byte sequences and characters
which are not allowed in XML 1.0.

=item AddText ( STRING )

Output STRING.  STRING must be valid UTF-8.

=item AddCharacter ( C )

Output the Unicode character with codepoint C (an integer).  This is
normally obtained by ord().

=item Comment ( STRING )

Output STRING as an XML comment.  Genx will complain if STRING
contains "--".

=item PI ( TARGET, STRING )

Output a processing instruction, with target TARGET and STRING as the
body.  Genx will complain if STRING contains "?>" or if TARGET is the
string "xml" (in any case).

=item UnsetDefaultNamespace ( )

Insert an C< xmlns="" > attribute.  Has no effect if the default
namespace is already in effect.

=item GetVersion ( )

Return the version number of the Genx library in use.

=item DeclareNamespace ( URI, PREFIX )

Returns a new namespace object.  The resulting object has two methods
defined on it.

=over 4

=item GetNamespacePrefix ( )

Returns the current prefix in scope for this namespace.

=item AddNamespace ( [PREFIX] )

Adds the namespace into the document, optionally with PREFIX.

=back

B<NB>: This object is only valid as long as the original L<XML::Genx>
object that created it is still alive.

=item DeclareElement ( [NS], NAME )

Returns a new element object.  NS must an object returned by
DeclareNamespace(), or undef to indicate no namespace (or not present
at all).

The resulting object has one method available to call.

=over 4

=item StartElement ( )

Outputs a start tag.

=back

B<NB>: This object is only valid as long as the original L<XML::Genx>
object that created it is still alive.

=item DeclareAttribute ( [NS], NAME )

Returns a new attribute object.  NS must an object returned by
DeclareNamespace(), or undef to indicate no namespace (or not present
at all).

There is one method defined for this object.

=over 4

=item AddAttribute ( VALUE )

Adds an attribute to the current element with VALUE as the contents.

=back

B<NB>: This object is only valid as long as the original L<XML::Genx>
object that created it is still alive.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

According to the Genx manual, the things that Genx can't do include:

=over 4

=item *

Generating output in anything but UTF8.

=item *

Writing namespace-oblivious XML. That is to say, you can't have an
element or attribute named foo:bar unless foo is a prefix associated
with some namespace.

=item *

Empty-element tags.

=item *

Writing XML or <!DOCTYPE> declarations. Of course, you could squeeze
these into the output stream yourself before any Genx calls that
generate output.

=item *

Pretty-printing. Of course, you can pretty-print yourself by putting the
linebreaks in the right places and indenting appropriately, but Genx
won't do it for you. Someone might want to write a pretty-printer that
sits on top of Genx.
